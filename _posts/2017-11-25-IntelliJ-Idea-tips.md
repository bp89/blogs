As a developer everybody faces lots of challenges everyday. And we start finding tools that make life of a developer easy.

Certainly, this search for tools had given birth to IDEs i.e. Integrated Development Environment. Using an IDE makes a 
developer's life very easy. From auto suggestion to formatting to pointing out issues and so on. Today we have very powerful IDEs but very few realize that power
and end up using only few of the known features. Though they are able to make their developer's life easy but not the easiest. There are several reasons to not efficiently use an IDE.
One could be that you never realised that it could even be more easier and effective just by knowing some cool features. Another could be you never got time to explore IDE.

It's okay! We all go through such phase and over the time when we learn to make ourselves more efficient we become so called veteran or experienced in layman's term.

Hope so far we have set the stage for why as soon as possible we should know our ship of programming i.e. IDE. 

Intelli J Idea had proved to be one of the powerful IDE. It supports so many languages from java, kotlin, python to js and so on. 


Below are some of the best practices. It might be time taking for a while but improve your efficiency and productivity drastically:-


1. Always use keyboard shortcuts rather than mouse. It takes lot of energy to perform mouse shortcut than a keyboard shortcut action. You might find it very difficult initially but as you get into practice, but over the time
you will realize the improvement.

To help you remember keys quickly use `IDea Key Promoter` . Whenever you will use mouse operation, it will show a pop up showing the shortcut so that you remember it for next time. See example below:-

2. Use code generators rather than writing the whole code by hand. After all you have already practiced it all a lot in early times.

In Idea you could right click anywhere on a file and click on `Generate` to generate code.

![Generate Code]({{site.baseurl }}/images/2017-11-25-IntelliJ-Idea-tips/generate.png)

This will show options as below:-

![Generate Options]({{site.baseurl }}/images/2017-11-25-IntelliJ-Idea-tips/generate-options.png)

3. Use `Live templates` so that you don't have to type long statements repeatedly by hands. e.g. if you have to 
type `System.out.println` in idea you could use `sout` and press `CTRL + space`.

Below is a screenshot of Idea live templates. You could start remembering these and saving efforts .

4. Try not to switch between different task windows as this diverts you from original goal i.e. develop better software.

So, in Intelli J Idea, use:-

1. it's own terminal

2. it's own database support. Beautiful query evaluation and CRUDs are provided.

3. it's version control feature - all-in-one place makes it very comfortable to focus on priorities than verbose tasks.

4. Inbuilt support for  **Build Tools** :-

You could explore more in detail but above are some of frequently used idea features.

5. Even inbuilt browsers are coming with IDEs so that you don't need to open seperate browser.


6. Use IDE's in-built Run and Debug configuration effectively. It allows lots of features and debugging is very easy when application is run from IDE.


7. Use IDEs navigation support effectively. e.g. Idea provides lots of shortcuts and options to navigate between files. It reduces navigation time exceptionally.
