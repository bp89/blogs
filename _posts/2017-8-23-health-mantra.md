There has been a time when our ancestors used to follow a near to perfect diet plan. They were more healthier and living longer life.

Nowadays I have seen people from different age groups suffering from different problems like Blood Pressure, Stress, Asthama, Joint Pains, Weakness and many others.
Question is not how to cure these. Question is how to prevent these? I have heard people saying that lifestyle is the problem. 

A bad lifestyle causes you age faster and get more types of illnesses by weakening your immune system. Well I will say just improve one part of your lifestyle and believe me rest of your lifestyle will automatically revolve around it.
So, change your diet and the timing of intake. So, you want to stay energised whole day? You want to keep yourself slim fit all the time? 
If yes! Then wait for you to be hungry and eat at specified time only.

So, Mantra no. 1:-

> Never eat unless you are hungry...

Why so? The basic reason behind it is our saliva. Our glands produce very high quality semi-liquid fluid that contains everything our stomach need to digest the food, extract best out of it and digest faster with less energy consumption via blood circulation in your body.

So, when you eat without being hungry and just being gourmet following happens:-

1. Your body produces very less quantity of saliva.
2. You will feel lazy and won't be much focused or alert as most of the blood in your body in focused on digesting the food. Your brain might start loosing it's efficiency due 
3. You don't chew the food well which adds extra burden on your stomach.
4. Your body don't understand when to produce the acids and other enzymes in the liver to digest the food. It causes acidity problems or Gastric. Our stomach says maintain the PH to neutral. Our saliva does this job well.

Let's understand it in more detail. If you notice every medicine from any Pathy whether Yunani or Aloepathy etc is constituted of or contains the body demanded nutrition e.g. vitamins, minerals, fibers etc.
You eat these medicines and you digestion system gets some nutrition in larger quantity. But you don't produce saliva for that. You don't mix this secret ingredient into what you are eating. 
So, the point is when you are hungry enough, then only eat and eat slowly. Let the saliva mix in your food while you chew. This will make you digest faster and enzymes will help extract more nutrition from food.

Mantra no. 2:-

> Never drink water while eating or after eating

If you are doing this, you are inviting more than 50 stomach problems. While taking few sips of water is okay. Drinking full glass of water would be very harmful.
Even the water you sip should be warmer and have similar temperature as of your food.

If you Drink water while eating, following will happen:-

1. Your digestion system heat will be gone i.e. your food isn't getting digested but will be getting kinda fermented now. 
2. You will eat less as your liver has a limited capacity. Even if you could develop more capacity, it's impacting the health of your lever.
3. Drinking cold water will also impact your immune system.
4. Drinking water (especially cold water) during eating will shrink saliva producting organs.

Some people raised the concern that why do we drink Lemon water or Warm water or eat Curd or drink juice etc while eating.

Well these liquid items have different effects and these help in burning your stomach heat at higher pace. Hence, if you take juice or drink warm lemon water this will boost your digestion. But avoid water.

Mantra no. 3 :-

> Eat only 3 times a day. In any case don't let it extend beyond 4 times.

Heavy workout people could be exceptions here but they should even try to follow same schedule but with more nutritional diet than less nutritional diet intake more than 3-4 times.
Well you might have heared nutritionist saying take smaller diets multiple times. That's wrong wrong and wrong. Take your diet only 3 times a day. This will help you in following:-

1. When our stomach do digest the food the blood in body flows towards stomach. That's the reason you feel sleepy or bit dizzy. Hence, when you take smaller diets your stomach will try to digest the food and hence your brain might be less focused throughout the day.Also, this could lead to joint pains due to less blood circulation to those areas.
2. Your stomach heat should not be there whole day. As this would cause more acid production in body and the time you missed a diet, you are going to produce more acid and hence acidity problem would be there which in turn gives birth to 25 other illness. 


Mantra no. 4 :-

> Take very heavy diet in breakfast, a bit less heavy in lunch and a very small diet in evening followed by Milk (1 hour gap between your dinner and Milk intake should be there)

Nowadays people follow the opposite diet. They don't eat or eat very less in morning, eat a little bit more in lunch and take a very heavy dinner.

You are inviting so many problems to your body by doing this. 

Why? Following are the reasons for same:-
 
1. When you needed more energy you eat less. Your demand and supply chain is broken.
2. Our body function like that in morning it is open to intake i.e. it demands food intake. In evening our body's extraction system is more active i.e. it starts preparing for throwing away bad stuff out of your body.
3. If you eat more in night, it will cause sleep related problems are now more blood will flow towards your stomach and hence your body system will need to remain active for more time.


Mantra no. 5:-

> Choose your diet right.


Please, please choose your diet right. Looks up for more green vegetables. Add some fruits to your Menu. Add juices, milk and more nutritional products. If you could avoid non-veg would be great. If not choose right type of it.
 Always eating chiken is not a good idea. Try adding different sea foods to your diet plan.
 
Mantra no. 6:-

> Take a Nap of 10-15 minutes after eating. In night just sleep :)


Most important take a nap and just let your body parts relax for 10-15 minutes. If you could lay on left side would be great as your liver & heart is on that side. And blood circulation direction too is clockwise. 

Dear friends follow these 6 Mantra for a month and you will see the change. Following are the most common changes to lifestyle that happen after this:-
 
 1. You will start sleeping on time in evening because you would be low on energy & body needs to recover. 
 2. You will wake up early in morning beacause your body didn't took much diet in night and hence digestion was very fast and near to perfect. Hence, your extraction system would be more active.
 3. You will be very hungry after an hour  after going to washroom for your routine. You could utilize this 1 hour for excercise.
 4. Your saliva generation would be on peek due to hunger so eat as much as you can but chew well so that saliva mixes. You could develop a habbit of glancing your food like you adore it a lot while eating and putting complete focus on eating only.
